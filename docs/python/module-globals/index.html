<div class="admonition-verdict admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Verdict</p>
<p>Like several other scripting languages,
Python parses the outer level of each module as normal code.
Un-indented assignment statements, expressions,
and even loops and conditionals
will execute as the module is imported.
This presents an excellent opportunity
to supplement a module’s classes and functions
with constants and data structures that callers will find useful —
but also offers dangerous temptations:
mutable global objects can wind up coupling distant code,
and I/O operations impose import-time expense and side effects.</p>
</div>
<p>Every Python module is a separate namespace.
A module like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">json</span></code> can offer a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loads()</span></code> function
without conflicting with, replacing, or overwriting
the completely different <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">loads()</span></code> function
defined over in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pickle</span></code> module.</p>
<p>Separate namespaces are crucial to making a programming language tractable.
If Python modules were not separate namespaces,
you would be unable to read or write Python code
by keeping your attention focused on the module in front of you —
a line of code might use, or accidentally conflict with,
a name defined anywhere else in the Standard Library
or a third-party module you have installed.
Upgrading a third-party module could break your entire program
if the new version defined a new global that conflicted with yours.
Programmers who are forced to code in a language without namespaces
soon find themselves festooning global names
with prefixes, suffixes, and extra punctuation
in a desperate race to keep them from conflicting.</p>
<p>While every function and class is, of course, an object —
in Python, everything is an object —
the Module Global pattern more specifically refers
to normal object instances
that are given names at the global level of a module.</p>
<p>Two patterns use Module Globals
but are important enough to warrant their own articles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../prebound-methods/"><span class="doc">Prebound Methods</span></a>
are generated when a module builds an object
and then assigns one or more of the object’s bound methods
to names at the module’s global level.
The names can be used to call the methods later
without needing to find the object itself.</p></li>
<li><p>While a <a class="reference internal" href="../sentinel-object/"><span class="doc">Sentinel Object</span></a>
doesn’t have to live in a module’s global namespace —
some sentinel objects are defined as class attributes,
while others are private and live inside of a closure —
many sentinels, both in the Standard Library and beyond,
are defined and accessed as module globals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This article will cover some other common cases.</p>
<section id="the-constant-pattern">
<h2>The Constant Pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#the-constant-pattern" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Modules often assign useful numbers, strings, and other values
to names in their global scope.
The Standard Library includes many such assignments,
from which we can excerpt a few examples.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">January</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span>                   <span class="c1"># calendar.py</span>
<span class="n">WARNING</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">30</span>                  <span class="c1"># logging.py</span>
<span class="n">MAX_INTERPOLATION_DEPTH</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">10</span>  <span class="c1"># configparser.py</span>
<span class="n">SSL_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mf">60.0</span>  <span class="c1"># asyncio.constants.py</span>
<span class="n">TICK</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&#39;&quot;</span>                    <span class="c1"># email.utils.py</span>
<span class="n">CRLF</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\r\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span>                 <span class="c1"># smtplib.py</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Remember that these are “constants” only in the sense
that the objects themselves are immutable.
The names can still be reassigned.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">calendar</span>
<span class="n">calendar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">January</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">13</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">calendar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">January</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>13
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or deleted, for that matter.</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">del</span> <span class="n">calendar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">January</span>
<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">calendar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">January</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
AttributeError: module &#39;calendar&#39; has no attribute &#39;January&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In addition to integers, floats, and strings,
constants also include immutable containers like tuples and frozen sets:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">all_errors</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Error</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ne">OSError</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ne">EOFError</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># ftplib.py</span>
<span class="n">bytes_types</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">bytes</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nb">bytearray</span><span class="p">)</span>         <span class="c1"># pickle.py</span>
<span class="n">DIGITS</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">frozenset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;0123456789&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>         <span class="c1"># sre_parse.py</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>More specialized immutable data types also serve as constants:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">_EPOCH</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1970</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">tzinfo</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">timezone</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">utc</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># datetime</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>On rare occasions,
a module global
which the code clearly never intends to modify
uses a mutable data structure anyway.
Plain mutable sets
are common in code that pre-dates the invention of the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">frozenset</span></code>.
Dictionaries are still used today
because, alas, the Standard Library doesn’t offer a frozen dictionary.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># socket.py</span>
<span class="n">_blocking_errnos</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="n">EAGAIN</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">EWOULDBLOCK</span> <span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># locale.py</span>
<span class="n">windows_locale</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="mh">0x0436</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;af_ZA&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1"># Afrikaans</span>
  <span class="mh">0x041c</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;sq_AL&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1"># Albanian</span>
  <span class="mh">0x0484</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;gsw_FR&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="c1"># Alsatian - France</span>
  <span class="o">...</span>
  <span class="mh">0x0435</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;zu_ZA&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="c1"># Zulu</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Constants are often introduced as a refactoring:
the programmer notices that the same value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">60.0</span></code>
is appearing repeatedly in their code,
and so introduces a constant <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">SSL_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT</span></code>
for the value instead.
Each use of the name
will now incur the slight cost of a search into the global scope,
but this is balanced by a couple of advantages.
The constant’s name now documents the value’s meaning,
improving the code’s readability.
And the constant’s assignment statement
now provides a single location
where the value can be edited in the future
without needing to hunt through the code for each place <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">60.0</span></code> was used.</p>
<p>These advantages are weighty enough
that a constant is sometimes introduced
even for a value that’s used only once,
hoisting a literal that was hidden deep in the code
up into visibility as a global.</p>
<p>Some programmers place constant assignments
close to the code that use them;
others put all constants at the top of the file.
Unless a constant is placed so close to its code
that it will always be in view of human readers,
it can be more friendly to put constants at the top of the module
for the easy reference of readers
who haven’t yet configured their editors to support jump-to-definition.</p>
<p>Another kind of constant is not directed inwards,
towards the code in the module itself,
but outwards as part of the module’s advertised API.
A constant like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">WARNING</span></code> from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">logging</span></code> module
offers the advantages of a constant to the caller:
code will be more readable,
and the constant’s value could be adjusted later
without every caller needing to edit their code.</p>
<p>You might expect that a constant intended for the module’s own use,
but not intended for callers,
would always start with an underscore to mark it private.
But Python programmers are not consistent in marking constants private,
perhaps because the cost of needing to keep a constant around forever
because a caller might have decided to start using it
is smaller than the cost of having
a helper function or class’s API forever locked up.</p>

<section id="import-time-computation">
<h2>Import-time computation<a class="headerlink" href="#import-time-computation" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes constants are introduced for efficiency,
to avoid recomputing a value every time code is called.
For example,
even though math operations involving literal numbers
are in fact optimized away in all modern Python implementations,
developers often still feel more comfortable
making it explicit that the math should be done at import time
by assigning the result to a module global:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># zipfile.py</span>
<span class="n">ZIP_FILECOUNT_LIMIT</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span> <span class="mi">16</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When the math expression is complicated,
assigning a name also enhances the code’s readability.</p>
<p>As another example,
there exist special floating point values
that cannot be written in Python as literals;
they can only be generated by passing a string to the float type.
To avoid calling <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">float()</span></code> with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'nan'</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'inf'</span></code>
every single time such a value is needed,
modules often build such values only once as module globals.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># encoder.py</span>
<span class="n">INFINITY</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">float</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;inf&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A constant can also capture the result of a conditional
to avoid re-evaluating it each time the value is needed —
as long, of course, as the condition
won’t be changing while the program is running.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># shutil.py</span>
<span class="n">COPY_BUFSIZE</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1024</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1024</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">_WINDOWS</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="mi">16</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="mi">1024</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>My favorite example of computed constants in the Standard Library
is the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">types</span></code> module.
I had always assumed it was implemented in C,
to gain special access to built-in type objects like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FunctionType</span></code>
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">LambdaType</span></code> that are defined by the language implementation itself.</p>
<p>It turns out? I was wrong. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">types</span></code> module is written in plain Python!</p>
<p>Without any special access to language internals,
it does what anyone else would do to learn what type functions have.
It creates a function, then asks its type:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># types.py</span>
<span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">_f</span><span class="p">():</span> <span class="k">pass</span>
<span class="n">FunctionType</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_f</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>On the one hand,
this makes the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">types</span></code> module seem almost superfluous —
you could always use the same trick to discover <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FunctionType</span></code> yourself.
But on the other hand,
importing it from <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">types</span></code>
lets both major benefits of the Constant Pattern shine:
code becomes more readable
because <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">FunctionType</span></code> will have the same name everywhere,
and more efficient
because the constant only needs to be computed once
no matter how many modules in a large system might use it.</p>
</section>
<section id="dunder-constants">
<h2>Dunder Constants<a class="headerlink" href="#dunder-constants" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>A special case of constants defined at a module’s global level
are “dunder” constants whose names start and end with double underscores.</p>
<p>Several Module Global dunder constants are set by the language itself.
For the official list,
look for the “Modules” subheading in the Python Reference’s section on
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy">the standard type hierarchy</a>.
The two encountered most often are <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__name__</span></code>,
which programs need to check because of Python’s awful design decision
to assign the fake name <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">'__main__'</span></code>
to the module invoked from the command line,
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__file__</span></code>,
the full filesystem path to the module’s Python file itself —
which is almost universally used to find data files included in a package,
even though the official recommendation these days
is to use <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pkgutil.html#pkgutil.get_data"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkgutil.get_data()</span></code></a> instead.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">here</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dirname</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vm">__file__</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Beyond the dunder constants set by the language runtime,
there is one Python recognizes if a module chooses to set it:
if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__all__</span></code> is assigned a sequence of identifiers,
then only those names will be imported into another module
that does <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">from</span> <span class="pre">…</span> <span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">*</span></code>.
You might have expected <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__all__</span></code> to become less popular
as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">*</span></code> gained a reputation as an anti-pattern,
but it has gained a happy second career
limiting the list of symbols included
by automatic documentation engines like
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html">Sphinx autodoc module</a>.</p>
<p>Even though most modules never plan to modify <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__all__</span></code>,
they inexplicably specify it as a Python list.
It is more elegant to use a tuple.</p>
<p>Beyond these official dunder constants,
some modules add even more.
Assignments to names like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__author__</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__version__</span></code>
are scattered across the Standard Library and beyond.
Tools tend to ignore these non-standard names,
but a human reader might occasionally find them informative.</p>
<p>Beware that there does not seem to be agreement,
even within the Standard Library,
about what type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">__author__</span></code> should have.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># bz2.py</span>
<span class="n">__author__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Nadeem Vawda &lt;nadeem.vawda@gmail.com&gt;&quot;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># inspect.py</span>
<span class="n">__author__</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Ka-Ping Yee &lt;ping@lfw.org&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
              <span class="s1">&#39;Yury Selivanov &lt;yselivanov@sprymix.com&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Why not <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">author</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">version</span></code> instead, without the dunders?
An early reader probably misunderstood dunders,
which really meant “special to the Python language runtime,”
as a vague indication
that a value was module metadata rather than module code.
A few Standard Library modules do offer their version without dunders,
but without even agreeing on the capitalization.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">VERSION</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;1.3.0&quot;</span>  <span class="c1"># etree/ElementTree.py</span>
<span class="n">version</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;0.20&quot;</span>   <span class="c1"># sax/expatreader.py</span>
<span class="n">version</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;0.9.0&quot;</span>  <span class="c1"># tarfile.py</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>To avoid the inconsistencies surrounding
these informal and ad-hoc metadata conventions,
a package that expects to be installed with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pip</span></code>
can learn the names and versions of other installed packages
directly from the Python package installation system.
More information is available in the <a class="reference external" href="https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pkg_resources.html">setuptools documentation on the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pkg_resources</span></code> module</a>.</p>

<section id="id1">
<h2>The Global Object Pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the full-fledged Global Object pattern,
as in the Constant pattern,
a module instantiates an object at import time
and assigns it a name in the module’s global scope.
But the object does not simply serve as data;
it is not merely an integer, string, or data structure.
Instead, the object is made available
for the sake of the methods it offers — for the actions it can perform.</p>
<p>The simplest Global Objects are immutable.
A common example is a compiled regular expression —
here are a few examples from the Standard Library:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">escapesre</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">r</span><span class="s1">&#39;[</span><span class="se">\\</span><span class="s1">&quot;]&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>       <span class="c1"># email/utils.py</span>
<span class="n">magic_check</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;([*?[])&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>    <span class="c1"># glob.py</span>
<span class="n">commentclose</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">r</span><span class="s1">&#39;--\s*&gt;&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>   <span class="c1"># html/parser.py</span>
<span class="n">HAS_UTF8</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">re</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">b</span><span class="s1">&#39;[</span><span class="se">\x80</span><span class="s1">-</span><span class="se">\xff</span><span class="s1">]&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># json/encoder.py</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Compiling a regular expression as a module global
is a good example of the more general Global Object pattern.
It achieves an elegant and safe transfer of expense
from later in a program’s runtime to import time instead.
The tradeoffs are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The cost of importing the module increases
by the cost of compiling the regular expression
(plus the tiny cost of assigning it to a global name).</p></li>
<li><p>The import-time cost is now borne by every program that imports the module.
Even if a program doesn’t happen to call any code
that uses the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">HAS_UTF8</span></code> regular expression shown above,
it will incur the expense of compiling it
whenever it imports the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">json</span></code> module.
(Plot twist: in Python 3, the pattern is no longer even used in the module!
But its name was not marked private with a leading underscore,
so I suppose it’s not safe to remove —
and every <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">import</span> <span class="pre">json</span></code> gets to pay its cost forever?)</p></li>
<li><p>But functions and methods that do, in fact,
need to use the regular expression
will no longer incur a repeated cost for its compilation.
The compiled regular expression
is ready to start scanning a string immediately!
If the regular expression is used frequently,
like in the inner loop of a costly operation like parsing,
the savings can be considerable.</p></li>
<li><p>The global name will make calling code more readable
than if the regular expression, when used locally,
is used anonymously in a larger expression.
(If readability is the only concern, though,
remember that you can define the regular expression’s string as a global
but skip the cost of compiling it at module level.)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This list of tradeoffs is about the same, by the way,
if you move a regular expression out into a class attribute
instead of moving it all the way out to the global scope.
When I finally get around to writing about Python and classes,
I’ll link from here to further thoughts on class attributes.</p>

<p>But what about Global Objects that are mutable?</p>
<p>They are easiest to justify when they wrap system resources
that are by their nature also global to an operating system process.
One example in the Standard Library itself is the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">environ</span></code>
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.environ">object</a>
that gives your Python program the “environment” —
the text keys and values supplying your timezone, terminal type, so forth —
that was passed to your Python program from its parent process.</p>
<p>Now,
it is arguable whether your program
should really be writing new values into its environment as it runs.
If you’re launching a subprocess
that needs an environment variable adjusted,
the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">subprocess</span></code> routines offer an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">env</span></code> parameter.
But if code does need to manipulate this global resource,
then it makes sense for that access to be mediated
by a correspondingly global Python object:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># os.py</span>
<span class="n">environ</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">_createenviron</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Through this global object,
the various routines, and perhaps threads, in a Python program
coordinate their access to this process-wide resource.
Any change:</p>
<div class="highlight-python notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">os</span>
<span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;TERM&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;xterm&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>— will be immediately visible to any other part of the program
that reads that environment key:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">os</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">environ</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;TERM&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="go">&#39;xterm&#39;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The problems with coupling distant parts of your codebase,
and even unrelated parts of different libraries,
through a unique global object are well known.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Tests that were previously independent
are suddenly coupled through the global object
and can no longer safely be run in parallel.
If one test makes a temporary assignment to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">environ['PATH']</span></code>
just before another test launches a binary with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">subprocess</span></code>,
the binary will inherit the test value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">$PATH</span></code> —
possibly causing an error.</p></li>
<li><p>You can sometimes serialize access to a global object through a lock.
But unless you do a thorough audit
of all of the libraries your code uses,
and continue to audit them when upgrading to new versions,
it can be difficult to even know which tests call code
that ultimately touches particular global object like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">environ</span></code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Even tests run serially, not in parallel, will now wind up coupled
if one test fails to restore <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">environ</span></code> to its original state
before the next test runs.
This can, it’s true, be mitigated with teardown routines
or with mocks that automatically restore state.
But unless every single test is perfectly cautious,
your test suite can still suffer from exceptions
that depend on random test ordering
or on whether a previous test succeeded or exited early.</p></li>
<li><p>These dangers beset not only tests but production runs as well.
Even if your application doesn’t launch multiple threads,
there can be surprising cases
where a refactoring winds up calling code
that performs one operation on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">environ</span></code>
right in the middle of another routine
that was also in the middle of transforming its state.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The Standard Library has more examples of the Mutable Global pattern —
both public globals and private ones litter its modules.
Some correspond to unique resources at the system level:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Lib/multiprocessing/process.py</span>
<span class="n">_current_process</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">_MainProcess</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">_process_counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">itertools</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Others correspond to no outside resource
but instead serve as single points of coordination
for a process-wide activity like logging:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Lib/logging/__init__.py</span>
<span class="n">root</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">RootLogger</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">WARNING</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Third-party libraries can supply dozens of more examples,
from global HTTP thread pools and database connections
to registries of request handlers, library plugins, and third-party codecs.
But in every case,
the Mutable Global courts all of the dangers listed above
in return for the convenience
of putting a resource where every module can reach it.</p>
<p>My advice, to the extent that you can,
is to write code that accepts arguments
and returns values computed from them.
Failing that, try passing database connections or open sockets
to code that will need to interact with the outside world.
It is a compromise
for code that finds itself stranded from the resources it needs
to resort to accessing a global.</p>
<p>The glory of Python, of course,
is that it usually makes even anti-patterns and compromises
read fairly elegantly in code.
An assignment statement at the global level of a module
is as easy to write and read as any other assignment statement,
and callers can access the Mutable Global
through exactly the same import statement
they use for functions and classes.</p>

<section id="import-time-i-o">
<h2>Import-time I/O<a class="headerlink" href="#import-time-i-o" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many of the worst Global Objects are those
that perform file or network I/O at import time.
They not only impose the cost of that I/O
on every library, script, and test that need the module,
but expose them to failure if a file or network is not available.</p>
<p>Library authors have an unfortunate tendency to make assumptions like
“the file <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/hosts</span></code> will always exist”
when, in fact, they can’t know ahead of time
all the exotic environments their code will one day face —
maybe a tiny embedded system that in fact lacks that file;
maybe a continuous integration environment
spinning up containers that lack any network configuration at all.</p>
<p>Even when faced with this possibility,
a module author might still try to defend their import-time I/O:
“But delaying the I/O until after import time
simply postpones the inevitable —
if the system doesn’t have <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/hosts</span></code>
then the user will get exactly the same exception later anyway.”
The attempt to make this excuse reveals three misunderstandings:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Errors at import time are far more serious than errors at runtime.
Remember that at the moment your package is imported,
the program’s main routine has probably not started running —
the caller is usually still up in the middle
of the stack of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">import</span></code> statements at the top of their file.
They have probably not yet set up logging
and have not yet entered their application’s main <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">try…except</span></code>
block that catches and reports failures,
so any errors during import
will probably print directly to the standard output
instead of getting properly reported.</p></li>
<li><p>Applications are often written
to survive the failure of some operations
so that in an emergency they can still perform other functions.
Even if features that need your library will now hit an exception,
the application might have many others it can continue to offer —
or could,
if you didn’t kill it with an exception at import time.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, library authors need to keep in mind
that a Python program that imports their library
might not even use it!
Never assume that simply because your code has been imported,
it will be used.
There are many situations where a module gets imported incidentally,
as the dependency of yet further modules,
but never happens to get called.
By performing I/O at import time,
you could impose expense and risk on hundreds of programs and tests
that don’t even need or care about your network port,
connection pool, or open file.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For all of these reasons,
it’s best for your global objects
to wait until they’re first called
before opening files and creating sockets —
because it’s at the moment of that first call
that the library knows the main program is now up and running,
and knows that its services are in fact definitely needed
in this particular run of the program.</p>
<p>I’ll admit that,
when my package needs to load a small data file
that’s embedded in the package itself,
I do sometimes break this rule.</p>
