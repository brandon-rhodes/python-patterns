<p><em>A pattern native to the Python language.</em></p>

<p class="admonition-title">Verdict</p>
<p>A powerful technique for offering callables
at the top level of your module
that share state through a common object.</p>
</div>
<p>There are occasions on which a Python module
wants to offer several routines
in the module’s global namespace
that will need to share state with each other at runtime.</p>
<p>Probably the most famous example
is the Python Standard Library’s <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html"><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random</span></code></a> module.
While it does provide advanced users
with the option to build their own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Random</span></code> instance,
most programmers opt for the convenient
slate of routines available in the module’s global namespace —
like
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randrange">randrange()</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.randint">randint()</a>,
and
<a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.choice">choice()</a> —
that mirror the methods of a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Random</span></code> object.</p>
<p>How do these top-level routines share state?</p>
<p>Behind the scenes these callables are, in fact, methods
that have all been bound ahead of time
to a single instance of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Random</span></code>
that the module itself has gone ahead and constructed.</p>
<p>After reviewing the problem that the Prebound Methods pattern solves,
we will see how the pattern looks in Python code.</p>
<section id="alternatives">
<h2>Alternatives<a class="headerlink" href="#alternatives" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The most primitive approach
to sharing state between a pair of module-level callables
is to write a pair of functions
that manipulate global data that’s stored next to them
at the top level of the module.</p>
<p>Imagine that we want to offer a simple random number generator.
It returns, in an endless loop,
the numbers 1 through 255 in a fixed pseudo-random order.
We also want to offer a simple <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">set_seed()</span></code> routine
that resets the state of the generator to a known value —
which is important both for tests that use random numbers,
and for simulations driven by pseudo-randomness
that want to offer reproducible results.</p>
<p>If Python only supported plain functions,
we might store the shared seed as a module global
that our functions would directly access and modify:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">datetime</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">datetime</span>

<span class="n">_seed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">microsecond</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">255</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span>

<span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">set_seed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">_seed</span>
    <span class="n">_seed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span>

<span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">random</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">_seed</span>
    <span class="n">_seed</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">carry</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">divmod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">_seed</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">carry</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">_seed</span> <span class="o">^=</span> <span class="mh">0xb8</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">_seed</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>There are several problems with this approach.</p>
<p>First, it is impossible to ever instantiate
a second copy of this random number generator.
If two threads each wanted their own generator
to avoid needing to protect it with locks,
then they would be out of luck.</p>
<p>(Okay, not really; this is Python.
Think of the possibilities!
You could import the module,
save a reference to it,
remove it from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">sys.modules</span></code> dictionary,
and then import it again to get a second copy.
Or you could manually instantiate a second module object
and copy all three names across.
By “out of luck” I refer only to sane Pythonic approaches.)</p>
<p>Second, it is more difficult to decouple
your random number generator tests from each other
if the generator’s state is global.
Instead of each test getting to create and exercise
a separate isolated instance,
the tests will all have to share the single generator
and correctly reset its state before the next test runs.</p>
<p>Third, this approach abandons encapsulation.
This will sound like a fuzzier complaint
than the previous two,
but it can detract from readability
(“readability counts”)
for a small tight system of two functions and a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">seed</span></code>
to be splayed out as three separate and not obviously related names
in a module which might contain dozens of other objects.</p>
<p>To solve the above problems, we indent the two functions
and wrap them up as methods of a new Python class.
The two methods and their state
can then be happily bundled together:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">datetime</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">datetime</span>

<span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">Random8</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set_seed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">datetime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">now</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">microsecond</span> <span class="o">%</span> <span class="mi">255</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">set_seed</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">seed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">value</span>

    <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">random</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">seed</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">carry</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">divmod</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">seed</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">carry</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">seed</span> <span class="o">^=</span> <span class="mh">0xb8</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">seed</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This imposes an extra step on the caller:
the object will have to be instantiated
before the two methods can be called.
Is there a way to let the caller skip that step?</p>
<p>The software engineer would do well to stop for a moment
and to think quite seriously
about the fact that in the vast majority of cases
simply defining a class like this is enough.
It will take only a single statement
for your user to create an instance of your class.
If their own application’s architecture is too deeply compromised
for them to easily pass the instance everywhere it’s needed,
they can always store the instance as a module global
in one of their own modules
for the use of the rest of their code.</p>
<p>There are several reasons that that the Prebound Methods pattern
is a particularly good fit for a random number generator:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Instantiating a random number generator
requires a system call —
in our case, asking for the date;
for the Python <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random</span></code> module,
fetching bytes from the system entropy pool.
If every module needing a random number
had to instantiate its own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Random</span></code> object,
then this cost would be incurred repeatedly.</p></li>
<li><p>Pseudo-random number generators
are an interesting case of a resource
whose behavior can be even more desirable when shared.
If you are the lone caller to an instance,
you see its completely predictable repeating sequence of values.
If instead you are sharing that instance with other code,
the generator will appear to skip ahead in its sequence unpredictably
each time other callers have themselves called the generator.</p></li>
<li><p>Since most users of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random</span></code>,
including several modules within the Standard Library,
import it specifically to use its module-level calls,
it is rare for the pre-built <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Random</span></code> instance that powers them
to languish unused.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the costs and benefits strike a similar balance
for a module of your own you are designing,
then the Prebound Method pattern
can let you deliver remarkable convenience.</p>

<h2>The pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#the-pattern" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>To offer your users a slate of Prebound Methods:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Instantiate your class at the top level of your module.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider assigning it a private name prefixed with an underscore <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">_</span></code>
that does not invite users to meddle with the object directly.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, assign a bound copy of each of the object’s methods
to the module’s global namespace.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For the random number generator that we used as an illustration above,
the entire module might look like this:</p>

<p>Users will now be able to invoke each method
as though it were a stand-alone function.
But the methods will secretly share state
thanks to the common instance that they are bound to,
without requiring the user to manage or pass that state explicitly.</p>
<p>When exercising this pattern,
please be responsible about the dangers
of instantiating an object at import time.
This pattern is usually not appropriate
for a class whose constructor creates files,
reads a database configuration,
opens sockets,
or that in general will inflict side effects on the program importing them.
In that case,
you will do better to either avoid the Prebound Methods pattern entirely,
or else to defer any actual side effects
until one of the methods is called.
You could choose a middle ground of providing a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">setup()</span></code> method
and requiring application programmers to invoke it
before they can expect any of the other routines to work.</p>
<p>But for lightweight objects
that can be instantiated without substantial delay or complication,
the Prebound Methods pattern is an elegant way
to make the stateful behavior of a class instance
available up at a module’s global level.</p>
<p>Examples of the pattern are strewn merrily across the Standard Library
even beyond the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">random</span></code> module we used as our example.
The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">calendar.py</span></code> module uses it:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">TextCalendar</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="o">...</span>

<span class="n">monthcalendar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">monthdayscalendar</span>
<span class="n">prweek</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prweek</span>
<span class="n">week</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">formatweek</span>
<span class="n">weekheader</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">formatweekheader</span>
<span class="n">prmonth</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prmonth</span>
<span class="n">month</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">formatmonth</span>
<span class="n">calendar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">formatyear</span>
<span class="n">prcal</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pryear</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As does the venerable old <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">reprlib.py</span></code>,
to offer a single <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">repr()</span></code> routine:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">aRepr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Repr</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="nb">repr</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">aRepr</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">repr</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As do several other modules —
you will find the Prebound Methods pattern
used with each of these Standard Library objects:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">distutils.log._global_log</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">multiprocessing.forkserver._forkserver</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">multiprocessing.semaphore_tracker._semaphore_tracker</span></code></p></li>
<li><p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">secrets._sysrand</span></code></p></li>
</ul>
<p>One final hint:
it is almost always better
to assign methods to global names explicitly.
Even if there are a dozen methods,
I recommend going ahead and writing
a quick stack of a dozen assignment statements
aligned at the left-hand column of your module
that make visible the whole list of global names you are defining.
The fact that Python is a dynamic language
might tempt you to automate the series of assignments instead,
using attribute introspection and a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loop.
I advise against it.
Python programmers believe that “Explicit is better than implicit” —
and materializing the stack of names as real code
will better support human readers,
language servers,
and even venerable old <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">grep</span></code>.</p>
