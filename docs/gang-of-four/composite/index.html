<p><em>A “Structural Pattern” from the</em> <a class="reference internal" href="../"><span class="doc">Gang of Four book</span></a></p>
<div class="admonition-verdict admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Verdict</p>
<p>The Composite Pattern can bring symmetry
not only to object hierarchies in Python,
but even to hierarchies exposed by low-level system calls
and high-level network applications.
In Python, the Composite Pattern can often be implemented
with less fuss than in tightly constrained object oriented languages.
You won’t be forced to inherit your container objects
and the objects inside of them
from a common parent class.
Instead, you can build classes
that share only a common interface rather than any implementation —
or that are simply duck typed to offer common behavior.</p>
</div>
<p>The Composite Pattern suggests
that whenever you design “container” objects
that collect and organize what we’ll call “content” objects,
you will simplify many operations
if you give container objects and content objects a shared set of methods
and thereby support as many operations as possible
without the caller having to care
whether they have been passed an individual content object
or an entire container.</p>
<p>This is such a general idea
that we can begin by stepping back from Python
and even from object-based programming,
and looking at how the Composite Pattern works
at the level of an operating system.</p>
<section id="example-the-unix-file-system">
<h2>Example: the UNIX file system<a class="headerlink" href="#example-the-unix-file-system" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The admirably pithy two-letter UNIX command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code>,
according to its manual page, stands for “list directory”
and when given the path to a directory
will list the files and subdirectories inside.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ls /usr
3bnet/       bin/         lbin/        lost+found/  options/     spool/
adm/         gnu/         lib/         mail/        preserve/    src/
admin/       include/     local/       news/        pub/         tmp/
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>But the name “list directory” is misleadingly narrow,
because <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> is also happy to be given a single file’s path
as its argument!</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ls /usr/bin/banner
/usr/bin/banner
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Of course, users rarely invoke <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> on a single file like this,
without specifying any option;
the only thing you learn is that the file exists
(if it doesn’t, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> will complain “No such file or directory”).
Its ability to accept single file names makes more sense
when combined with its “long listing” option.</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ls -l /usr/bin/banner
-r-xr-xr-x   1 bin      bin        12620 Mar  3  1988 /usr/bin/banner
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This symmetry —
that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> operates without complaint
on both individual files and also on the directories that contain them —
seems so natural to most users
that you might not notice the powerful design decision behind it.
It would have been very easy for an operating system author
to provide one command for listing a directory,
and an entirely different command
to show the attributes of one particular file.
But the lack of symmetry would have carried a cost.
While exploring the filesystem,
you would then have had to constantly remember
to switch from one command to the other
depending on whether the object of your attention was a directory or file.</p>
<p>Worse yet, two separate commands
would have provided no way to support wildcard operations
that might match both files and directories.
But, happily, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> has no problem with a heterogeneous
argument list that has both individual files and also a directory inside:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ls -C /etc/l*
/etc/labelit    /etc/ldsysdump  /etc/led        /etc/link

/etc/log:
filesave.log
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> has transparently detected
that four of the names matched by the wildcard <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/l*</span></code> are files
but that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">/etc/log</span></code> is a directory with more files inside.
(Well, with one file inside.)
Had UNIX supplied separate commands
for listing a file and listing a directory,
this wildcard could not safely have been an argument to either command.</p>
<p>This, at the level of a command line interface,
is the Composite Pattern.
Operations like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">du</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod</span></code>
that make sense on both files and directories
are implemented so that they run transparently on both.
This not only lowers cognitive overhead,
but makes shell scripts easier to write —
there are many operations that a script can simply run blindly
without needing to stop and check first whether a path
names a file or a directory.</p>
<p>The art of using the Composite Pattern
is determining where to break the symmetry.
For example, the UNIX filesystem provides completely different commands
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">touch</span></code> for creating a new file
and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">mkdir</span></code> for creating a new directory.
This could instead have been a single command
with an option that flipped it from file-creating mode
to directory-creating mode.
But the designers thought that the two operations
were conceptually different enough to deserve separate commands.
The decision of how much symmetry to create
will weigh upon each operation that a designer implements.</p>
<p>Forcing symmetry where there is really a difference
can create awkward special cases.
For example,
two of the three permission bits in UNIX
apply equally to directories and files:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> gives read permission and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">w</span></code> gives write permission.
But the symmetry breaks at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code>, the third bit,
which gives permission to “execute” a file
but to “search” a directory by using it in a path.
Should there have been two different <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod</span></code> commands,
one for files and one for directories?
Or should the single <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod</span></code> binary
at least have used a different letter for that third bit,
maybe <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> when applied to a file but <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">s</span></code> for “search”
when applied to a directory?
I myself think the designers of UNIX made the right decision here,
because I find it easier to remember
that <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x</span></code> means something a little different for a directory
than to remember a separate letter for directories,
or a separate command.
But the decision could have gone either way,
and making decisions like these
are where the designer applying the Composite Pattern needs finesse.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the symmetries
that exist between files and directories on the command line
are not exactly the same symmetries that exist
down beneath <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod</span></code> at the level of system calls.
At each level, the Composite Pattern was applied a bit differently.
For system calls, some symmetry does exist:
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stat()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chmod()</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">chown()</span></code>
operate happily on both files and directories.</p>
<p>But <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> is hiding the fact that if <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">stat()</span></code>
reveals that a path names a directory,
then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ls</span></code> needs to switch to a directory-specific system call
to list the files inside.
There is no symmetry
between the UNIX system call for reading a normal file’s content
and the call for reading the list of files in a directory,
and for a crucial reason:
the two operations return different types of data.
A file contains an unstructured stream of bytes;
a directory, a series of distinct filenames.
The question of return type
will serve as a very important guardrail when you are designing in Python:
if your desire to create symmetry between container and content
leads you to engineer calls
that require an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">if</span></code> statement or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isinstance()</span></code>
to safely handle their return value,
then the desire for symmetry has led you astray.</p>

<section id="on-hierarchies">
<h2>On hierarchies<a class="headerlink" href="#on-hierarchies" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we now turn our attention
to how the Composite Pattern looks in a programming language like Python,
we should ponder a question
that hangs above so much
of the object-oriented and design-pattern literature
from the 1990s:</p>
<p>Where have all the hierarchies gone?</p>
<p>The construction and manipulation of extensive hierarchies
was both a frequent exercise for new programmers
and a tedious labor for more experienced programmers.
Hours were spent deciding how hierarchies would be constructed,
what operations they would support,
and how their destructors could be safely invoked.
Hierarchies were everywhere.</p>
<p>And then they began to recede,
like a tide that having run far up the sand
begins to finally sweep out again.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Popular languages in the late 1990s
went wild for deeply nested package namespaces.
To take a modern example from Go,
the package <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">google.golang.org/appengine</span></code>, one must admit,
comes with a hard guarantee
that it won’t conflict with the name of a package from another firm.
The Zope 3 project, in its heyday,
happily festooned the Python Package Index
with multi-level package names
like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zope.app.form</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zope.app.i18n</span></code>.
But today most Python packages
opt for a simple non-compound name
that jostles alongside the names of all other Python packages.
And it almost never causes problems.</p></li>
<li><p>The programming curricula of yore were rife with binary search trees,
B+ trees, and tree balancing algorithms.
But in real code, trees are very scarce.
For every programmer who works on trees to, say,
to write a persistent storage engine like BoltDB or Redis,
a thousand programmers get to skip the exercise.
Python programmers don’t tend to use binary search trees;
we use the even faster hash table (the Python “dictionary”)
whose structure, as it happens, is entirely flat — not a hierarchy.</p></li>
<li><p>There was an era when hierarchy
was inherent in the structure of databases.
An employee record might hold a salary history right inside of it.
But while hierarchy continues to exist around the edges of data storage,
most recently in the form of NoSQL and document databases,
our workhorse data stores tend to be flat ones:
the relational database, the CSV file, the Pandas dataframe.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Again and again our discipline seems to revert back, where we can,
to tables and lists and arrays
where hierarchies might have reigned instead.
The principle has even been enshrined in the famous <em>Zen of Python:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Flat is better than nested.”</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The big exception,
the realm in which hierarchy does reign supreme today,
is the document.
Documents are almost universally processed and represented
as a hierarchy of sections and paragraphs
beneath which are spans of bold and italics and hyperlinks.
But the whole point of their being documents
is that we aren’t always forced
to build them in code using object and method calls.
Instead, when we can, we parse them from a native representation
that makes the hierarchy explicit and natural.
The great monument to the Composite Pattern on today’s web
is not document construction —
documents are usually delivered as HTML —
but document manipulation,
through the Document Object Model exposed for the use of JavaScript code.</p>
<p>I will leave for another time
my discussion of how the Document Object Model delivered a hierarchy,
so programmers invented jQuery because they preferred an array instead.</p>
<p>Let’s now turn to what the Composite pattern looks like in code.</p>
</section>
<section id="example-gui-programming-with-tkinter">
<h2>Example: GUI programming with Tkinter<a class="headerlink" href="#example-gui-programming-with-tkinter" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let’s imagine that we want to print to the screen
the hierarchy of frames and buttons
out of which we have built a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter,
which comes built in to Python.</p>
<p>It would have been easy enough for Tkinter’s designers
to have decided that only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Frame</span></code> containers
needed <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">winfo_children()</span></code> methods to list their children —
after all, simpler widgets like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Label</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Button</span></code>
aren’t supposed to contain children,
and could have omitted the method entirely.
But that asymmetry would have forced an <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">if</span></code> statement
into any routine that wanted to visit both frames and their children:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># If Frame objects alone had offered winfo_children()</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">isinstance</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">widget</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Frame</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">children</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">widget</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">winfo_children</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
<span class="k">else</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="c1"># carefully avoid calling winfo_children()</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This pattern, when it can’t be avoided,
can at least be improved by dodging the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">isinstance()</span></code> call
and instead using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">getattr()</span></code> with three arguments
to safely examine whether the object has the necessary method.
This decouples the code from the vexed question
of whether any other Tkinter widgets besides <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Frame</span></code>,
either today or in the future,
can also include children widgets inside:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="c1"># Improvement: check for methods, not classes</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
<span class="n">winfo_children</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">getattr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">Frame</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;winfo_children&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">winfo_children</span> <span class="ow">is</span> <span class="ow">not</span> <span class="kc">None</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">children</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">winfo_children</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>In either case,
the difference between container widgets and normal widgets
would have haunted every piece of code
that wanted to perform general processing.</p>
<p>But the authors of Tk chose, happily, to implement the Composite Pattern.
Instead of making <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">winfo_children()</span></code> a special method
that only <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Frame</span></code> widgets offer,
they made it a general method that is available
on <em>every single widget object!</em>
You never need to check whether it is present.
For containers, it returns their list of child widgets.
For other widgets? It simply returns an empty list.</p>
<p>Your code can therefore fly forward
and always assume the presence of the method.
Here, so that you can see a working example,
is a complete program that builds a simple Tkinter GUI
that can print out the widget hierarchy to the terminal:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nn">tkinter</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Tk</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Frame</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Button</span>

<p>The resulting printout looks like:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>* &lt;tkinter.Frame object .!frame&gt;
    * &lt;tkinter.Button object .!frame.!button&gt;
    * &lt;tkinter.Button object .!frame.!button2&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Thanks to the Composite Pattern symmetry between widgets,
no <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">if</span></code> statement is necessary
to handle whatever kind of widget is passed to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">print_tree()</span></code>.</p>
<p>Note that there is controversy among Composite Pattern
enthusiasts over whether all widgets should really act like containers —
isn’t it fraudulent, they ask,
for a widget to implement <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">winfo_children()</span></code>
if it’s not going to let you add child widgets?
What sense does it make for it to act like a halfway container
that supports read operations (“list children”)
without the corresponding write operations (“add child”)?
The more restrictive option
would be to avoid putting <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">winfo_children()</span></code> on all widgets
and instead only making truly general operations
like <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">winfo_rootx()</span></code> universal
(general, because all widgets have an <em>x</em>-coordinate).
I myself tend to enjoy interfaces more
when there is as much symmetry as possible.</p>
<p>If you study the Tkinter library —
which is perhaps the most classic object oriented module
in the entire Python Standard Library —
you will find several more instances
where a method that could have been limited to a few widgets
was instead made a common operation on them all
for the sake of simplicity
and for the convenience of all the code that uses them.
This is the Composite Pattern.</p>
</section>
<section id="implementation-to-inherit-or-not">
<h2>Implementation: to inherit, or not?<a class="headerlink" href="#implementation-to-inherit-or-not" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The benefits of the symmetry that the Composite Pattern creates
between containers and their contents
only accrue if the symmetry makes the objects interchangeable.
But here, some statically typed languages impose an obstacle.</p>
<p>One problem is posed by the most limited of the static languages.
In those languages,
objects of two different classes are only interchangeable
if they are subclasses of a single parent class
that implements the methods they have in common —
or, if one of the two classes inherits directly from the other.</p>
<p>In static languages that are a bit more powerful,
the restriction is gentler.
There is no strict need for a container and its contents
to share an implementation.
As long as both of them conform to an “interface”
that declares exactly which methods they implement in common,
the objects can be called symmetrically.</p>
<p>In Python, both of these restrictions evaporate!
You are free to position your code anywhere along the spectrum
of safety versus brevity that you prefer.
You can go the classic route and have a common superclass:</p>

<p>Or your objects can simply duck type the same interface,
and you can rely on tests to help you maintain the symmetries
between containers and contents.
(Where, for very simple scripts,
your “test” might simply be the fact that the code runs.)</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">Frame</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>

    <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">children</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">child_widgets</span>

<span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">Label</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">object</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="fm">__init__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">text</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">text</span>

    <span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">children</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">[]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Or you can choose another point
on the design spectrum between these two extremes.
Python supports many approaches:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The classic common superclass architecture,
shown in the first example above.</p></li>
<li><p>Making the superclass an abstract base class
with the tools inside Standard Library’s <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">abc</span></code> module.</p></li>
<li><p>Having the two classes share an interface,
like those supported by the old <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">zope.interface</span></code> package.</p></li>
<li><p>You could spin up a type checking library like MyPy
and use annotations to ask for hard guarantees
that all of the objects processed by your code —
both container and contents —
implement the runtime behaviors that your code requires.</p></li>
<li><p>You could duck type, and ask for neither permission or forgiveness!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because Python offers this whole range of approaches,
I choose not to define the Composite Pattern classically,
where it’s defined as one particular mechanism (a superclass)
for creating or enforcing symmetry.
Instead, I define it simply as the creation of symmetry
— by whatever means —
among the objects involved in concentric object hierarchies.</p>
