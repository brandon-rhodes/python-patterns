Python Patterns
===============

Welcome!

It’s time for me to start writing up, in one place,
my ideas about Python patterns
that are currently scattered across all of my talks and writing.

One reason is that, after all of these years,
my
`Python Design Patterns <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Er5K_nR5lDQ&t=1045s>`_
talk from 2012 is still one of my most popular —
despite conference video problems
that forced me to cut 20 minutes of material!
Another is that written material is easier
for other programmers to search, browse, and reference,
and can be corrected and improved as time goes on.

Inspired by the schedule that Doug Hellmann maintains
on his famous `Python Module of the Week <https://pymotw.com/3/>`_ site,
I am going to try writing up one design pattern each week.
You can watch for links to new material on my Twitter account:

And with those preliminaries complete,
here we go — my first two write-ups of design patterns,
that I’ll doubtless revisit and revise and correct many times
over the years as I learn more,
but that (deep breath) it’s time to hit “Publish” on:
